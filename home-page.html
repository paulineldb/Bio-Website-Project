        <h1>Alexander Benjamin Stevenson</h1>
        <h3>aka Al, Ally Bally, Onesie, Ones or Ninja</h3>
        <img id="hero-img" src="./images/Alex-logo.png">
        <h2>Where did he come from?</h2>
        <p>Alex was born in Sweden and moved to the UK at the ripe age of <em>one</em>. He is the second born son in a big family of <em>two</em>.
        Alex is brave, so brave in fact that he lives in Birmingham!</p>

        <h2>Where did he go?</h2>
        <p>Alex has an artistic soul, which compelled him to study Drama and Musical Theatre at univeristy, a curse put on him by some feywild creature, we have no doubt. Selling his soul to a pixie allowed him to move to London a year after his graduation where he played in some shows, notably as Richard in ... Richard III.</p>

		</div>

        <h2>Where is he going?</h2>
        <p>Alex was always interested by tech and computers. As a snotty child, he spent most of his time playing on a good old grey plastic, cube-looking machine.</p>
        <p>So it is no surprise that when given the chance to learn more about tech and potentially make a career out of it, he jumped on the occasion! He is uncertain of which path he is going to pick as of yet, but we are certain that he will eventually find his passion!</p>

        <h1>Flashback</h1>
        <h2>He's a little lad</h2>
        <p>Since childhood, Alex has inspired and impressed all who came in contact with him. He has been the source of such empowerment and strength that, when asked to describe him in five words or less, his family and closest friends all answered <em>"Oh god, run away!"</em>. Isn't that sweet?</p>
        <p>But how did he get to this near-god status you ask? Well, it all started when he became obsessed with Michael Jackson (remember, we mentionned the feywild and selling one's soul earlier) and decided that he would make music, just like his idol. Inspiring, for sure.</p>
        <p>It doesn't end there! The spicyness of his character he also acquired. How? Fajitas and Paella. The best things he has ever eaten. I don't think I need to say more.</p>
        <p>His strength, this writer believes, come from the many bones he has not broken, with the exception of the wrist he broke last march, forcing here to defer from Academy 28 and endure the tourment of Academy 29. He got a cool scar out of it though.</p>

        <h2>Who likes berries and cream</h2>
        <p>Alex is a man of many passions, here are some of them (I know you were burning to ge to this part):
            <ul>
                <li>Video Games: he mainly plays competitive pokemon (because he is a massive nerd).</li>
                <li>Music: he makes it.</li>
                <li>Football: he plays it. And occasionally breaks the hip of the opposing team's goalkeeper. What a surprising man.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Although his passions occupy most of his spare time, Alex would love to make more youtube videos. What do you mean you didn't know he made Youtube videos?? Unbelievable. He has a small niche in the gaming space that makes him a lil bit of cash on the side but stardome can only be achieved through consictency... which he doesn't possess enough of.</p>
        <p>WARNING: do not, under any circumstance, ask him to get in a car. You don't want to know <span id="spoiler">what happened</span> to the last person who did.</p>
